PART 1

Understanding opearators

'''

# TODO 1. Print the result of 5 plus 2
x = 5
y = 2
print(x+y)

# TODO 2. Print the result of 5 minus 2
print(x-y)

# TODO 3. Print the result of 5 times 2
print(x*y)

# TODO 4. Print the result of 5 divided by 2
print(x/y)

# TODO 5. Print the result of floor division or truncation division 5 // 2
print(x//y)

# TODO 6. Print the remainder of 5 / 2 using the modulo operator (%)
print(5%2)

# TODO 7. Print the result of 5 raised to the power of 2
print(5**2)

# TODO 8. Print the square root of 25
print (math.sqrt(25))
'''
PART 2

Transcribe the equations from part2.pdf preserving the order of operations with parenthesis as needed. Save
each as a variable and print the variable.
'''

# TODO 9. Equation 1
print((3*5)/(2+3))
# TODO 10. Equation 2
print ((math.sqrt(7+9))*2)
# TODO 11. Equation 3
print ((4-7)^3)
# TODO 12. Equation 4
print ((-19+100)**(.25))
# TODO 13. Equation 5
print(6%4)

'''
PART 3

Write two equations with the same operands and operators but that evaluate to different values. Store each in a
separate variable, then print the variables.
